## Film Query
### Week 6 Skill Distillery Homework

### Overview
- This project traverses through a database using MySQL and extracts information; searching for films via film ID or keywords.

### Topics
* MySQL
* Command Line navigation
* J-Unit

### How to Run
- The user is prompted to choose between searching by film ID, searching via a keyword or to exit the program.
- If film ID is chosen, the user can enter an ID and choose whether to display full or basic details. On no ID found, the user is notified and asked to re-enter an ID.
- If searching by keyword, the user can enter a keyword and if a match is found in the description or title, the film information is displayed. The number of matches found is also displayed.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned
**1. Stretch goals:**
- Figuring out that you have to create a new Inventory class to display the whole inventory for a specific film and its respective media condition.

**2. J-Unit:**
- Good practise with J Unit tests especially for the count of how many results are meant to be returned.
